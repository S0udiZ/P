"There once was a king, a knight, a preist and a fool."
"The king ruled his kingdom up NORTH with his loyal knight."

"The preist saw a calamity in an oracle he got,
he tried to talk to the king but he wouldn't listen,
after that he prayed everyday to the the god of the WEST to come and help."

"The fool felt something was wrong and decided to go on a journy the the SOUTH,
for he heard that everything good allways end down south."
